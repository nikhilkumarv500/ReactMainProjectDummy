This is a Reastaurant application Made using react and appwrite (an open source backend/database server provider).
In the current version of hosted application ( https://react-main-project.vercel.app ), appwrite doesnt allow me to use it for public hosting purpose.
However this link ( https://react-main-project-dummy.vercel.app ) is for the same project but with out appwrite database
